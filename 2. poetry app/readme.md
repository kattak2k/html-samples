## Project 2
>> external CSS file
##Media
basically to create responsive designs
```@media (max-width: 500px){
    body{
       background: red; 
    }
}```
A technique that allows us to set CSS styles that only activate, when the browser is a certain width.
```
##Color
```#F00 => where F is full & 0 is zero i.e. 
 1st F => amount of redness
 2nd 0 => amount of greeness
 3rd 0 => amount of blueness
 similarly #FFF gives white and #000 give black
```
##RGBA
rgba(255,255,255,1)
instead of 0..F scale, RGBA has 0..255 scale
